# MCQ Assessment Portal

## 📘 Project Description

This is a **Streamlit-based web application** that serves as an interactive **Multiple Choice Question (MCQ) assessment portal**. It leverages the **Google Gemini API** to dynamically generate MCQs based on user-defined subjects, difficulty levels, and counts. Users can submit their candidate information, answer the generated questions, and receive an **instant report card in PDF format**. All submission data is persistently stored in a `submissions.json` file.
